Welcome! My name is Evgenia Karunus.  

At the moment I'm mainly contributing to Lean/Mathlib.  

I've also done a couple of neurosciency projects, see <a href="https://github.com/lakesare/netpyneunit">NepyneUnit</a> (for testing the stats of your biological neural network simulations) and <a href="https://github.com/VH-Lab/NDR-matlab/pull/56">NDR-matlab</a> (for neurophysiology data parsing in Matlab).  

And I created <a href="https://memcode.com">memcode</a>.

Here's my <a href="https://lakesare.brick.do/">blog</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/lakesare">twitter<a>.  
And welcome to contact me at lakesare@gmail.com.
