Welcome! My name is Evgenia Karunus.  

I'm interested in mathematics and proof assistants, and I'm working on Lean at the moment. I've also participated in a surprising number of neuroscience-adjacent projects over the years.  

Here's my <a href="https://lakesare.brick.do/">blog</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/lakesare">twitter<a>.
