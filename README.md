Welcome! My name is Evgenia Karunus.  

I'm interested in mathematics and proof assistants, and I'm working on Lean at the moment.  

I've also participated in a surprising number of neuroscience-adjacent projects over the years, see <a href="https://github.com/lakesare/netpyneunit">NepyneUnit</a> (for testing your neural network simulations) and <a href="https://github.com/VH-Lab/NDR-matlab/pull/56">NDR-matlab</a> (for neurophysiology files parsing in Matlab).  

And I created <a href="https://memcode.com">memcode</a>.

Here's my <a href="https://lakesare.brick.do/">blog</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/lakesare">twitter<a>.  
And welcome to contact me at lakesare@gmail.com.
