Hi!

At the moment I'm primarily working on <a href="https://github.com/Paper-Proof/paper-proof">paperproof</a>, a proof tree interface for Lean.

Previously core team at <a href="https://github.com/transloadit/uppy">uppy</a>.  
Before that, created <a href="https://github.com/lakesare/memcode">memcode</a>.

Here's my <a href="https://lakesare.brick.do/">blog</a>.  
And welcome to contact me at lakesare@gmail.com.
