Welcome! My name is Evgenia Karunus.  

I've been programming for years, I'm into open-source and I created memcode.   

I'm interested in mathematics and proof assistants, and I'm working on Lean at the moment. I've also done a surprising number of neuroscience-adjacent projects over the years.  


Here's my <a href="https://lakesare.brick.do/">blog</a> and <a href="twitter.com/lakesare">Twitter<a>.  
And welcome to contact me at lakesare@gmail.com.
